1
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:35,558
Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.

2
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,143
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:40,104
- Bye.
- Bye.

4
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:42,652
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

5
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:46,031
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.

6
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,654
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.

7
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:51,987
Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to meet me.

8
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:54,698
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.

9
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:56,533
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.

10
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:58,417
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

11
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:00,791
- You look great.
- It's nice to have you back.

12
00:25:00,954 --> 00:25:03,048
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.

13
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:06,047
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?

14
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:07,673
Thank you, Miss Turner.

15
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:08,969
This way.

16
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:17,054
<i>Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.</i>

17
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:21,399
<i>When you see the red light go on,
please state in the following order:</i>

18
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:25,737
<i>Your destination,

19
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:28,778
<i>Surname first, Christian name
and initial.</i>

20
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:34,787
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

21
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:40,832
<i>Thank you. You are cleared through
Voiceprint Identification.</i>

22
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:42,871
Thank you.

23
00:25:49,794 --> 00:25:52,968
- Have I got time for breakfast?
- I think we can manage that.

24
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:54,220
How long have I got?

25
00:25:54,424 --> 00:25:56,893
Your flight leaves
in an hour and 10 minutes.

26
00:25:57,135 --> 00:26:00,605
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

27
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:04,059
It's been seven or eight months
since you were here, hasn't it?

28
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:06,361
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

29
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,110
I suppose you saw the work
on the new section?

30
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:11,817
- Coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

31
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:13,072
Oh, wait.

32
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:16,909
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

33
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:48,148
<i>- Dad?</i>
- Hello.

34
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:52,441
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hi, squirt. What are you doing?

35
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:55,030
<i>Playing.</i>

36
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:56,661
Where's Mummy?

37
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,371
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

38
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:01,082
- Who's taking care of you?
<i>- Rachel.</i>

39
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:04,707
- May I speak to Rachel, please?
<i>- She's gone to the bathroom.</i>

40
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:07,672
<i>Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?</i>

41
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:10,337
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

42
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,922
<i>Why not?</i>

43
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:14,679
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

44
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:17,557
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.

45
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:21,724
I'm going to send you
a very nice present, though.

46
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:24,268
<i>All right.</i>

47
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,603
- Anything special that you want?
<i>- Yes.</i>

48
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:27,900
What?

49
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:29,694
<i>A telephone.</i>

50
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:32,401
We've got lots of telephones already.

51
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:35,074
Can't you think of anything else
for your birthday?

52
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:36,951
Something very special?

53
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:38,615
<i>- Yes.</i>
- What?

54
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:40,075
<i>A bush baby.</i>

55
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:42,787
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.

56
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:45,961
I want you to tell Mummy
something for me. Will you remember?

57
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,919
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?

58
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:54,378
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

59
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:56,550
Now, will you tell her that?

60
00:27:57,505 --> 00:27:58,552
<i>Yes.</i>

61
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:01,389
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.

62
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:02,681
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:05,939
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow too, huh?

64
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:07,770
<i>All right.</i>

65
00:28:07,932 --> 00:28:10,560
Okay. Now, take care
and be a good girl, won't you?

66
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,027
<i>All right. Bye-bye.</i>

67
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,693
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.

68
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:32,833
- Elena, how nice to see you again.
- Heywood, what a wonderful surprise.

69
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:35,881
- You're looking wonderful.
- You're looking well too.

70
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:38,095
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.

71
00:28:38,338 --> 00:28:40,591
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do?

72
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,467
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

73
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,769
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

74
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:47,434
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

75
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,182
Do sit down.

76
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:51,559
- Well, we...
- No, no, please.

77
00:28:51,976 --> 00:28:53,444
Thank you.

78
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:56,485
- Would you like a drink, doctor?
- No, thank you.

79
00:28:56,689 --> 00:29:00,159
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

80
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,829
I'll just sit with you a minute.
Then I'll be off.

81
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:05,498
- Are you quite sure?
- Quite sure, thank you.

82
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,043
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

83
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:12,585
He's been doing some
underwater research in the Baltic...

84
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,880
...so I'm afraid we don't get to see
very much of each other these days.

85
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:20,721
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.

86
00:29:20,963 --> 00:29:23,933
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

87
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,180
We're going home.

88
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:30,266
We've just spent three months
calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.

89
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:33,189
- What about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

90
00:29:33,434 --> 00:29:34,731
Oh, are you?

91
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:40,697
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...

92
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,031
...but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there.

93
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:48,951
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

94
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,918
It's that for the past two weeks...

95
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,544
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

96
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:56,883
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

97
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:01,467
For one thing, when you phone the base,
all you get is a recording...

98
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:05,847
...which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

99
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:09,854
Probably having some trouble
with their equipment.

100
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:11,184
Yes.

101
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:13,475
Yes, that's what we thought at first...

102
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:16,269
...but it's been going on now
for the past 10 days.

103
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:19,272
You haven't been able to
contact anyone for 10 days?

104
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,857
That's right.

105
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:22,196
Oh, I see.

106
00:30:22,358 --> 00:30:26,033
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

107
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:29,161
...was denied permission
for an emergency landing.

108
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:30,412
That does sound odd.

109
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:33,795
I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about it.

110
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:37,916
Denying the men permission to land
violates the IAS Convention.

111
00:30:38,124 --> 00:30:40,968
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?

112
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:44,639
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.

113
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:52,188
At the risk of pressing you on a
point you seem reticent to discuss...

114
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,024
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

115
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:56,692
Well, certainly.

116
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:03,783
Quite frankly, we have had some very
reliable intelligence reports...

117
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:07,404
...that quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.

118
00:31:07,653 --> 00:31:11,658
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

119
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:14,286
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

120
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,634
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

121
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:25,721
...I'm really not at liberty
to discuss this.

122
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,512
I understand.

123
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:33,187
But this epidemic
could quite easily spread to our base.

124
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:35,481
We should be given all the facts.

125
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:37,524
Yes, I know.

126
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,569
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

127
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:49,158
Are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink'?

128
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:51,706
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.

129
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:54,997
I hope you and your wife can come
to the IAC Conference.

130
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:56,544
I hope we can make it.

131
00:31:56,744 --> 00:31:59,793
If you do, bring that darling
little daughter with you.

132
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:03,922
That'll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing.

133
00:32:04,168 --> 00:32:05,215
If we can, we will.

134
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:08,343
You've got an invitation
if you ever get to the States.

135
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:11,301
Gregor and I will look forward
to seeing you.

136
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,307
Goodbye, Elena.

137
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:16,598
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.

138
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:20,777
Whatever the reasons for your visit,
the very best of luck to you.

139
00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:22,024
Thank you.

140
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,487
Ladies.

141
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:21,173
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
I'm through now.

142
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:24,297
- Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- You're welcome.

143
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:38,353
Well...

144
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:41,648
...I know you will all
want to join with me...

145
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:45,774
...in welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague...

146
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:50,202
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

147
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:55,575
Dr. Floyd has come up specially
to Clavius to be with us today.

148
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:00,212
Before the briefing, he'd like to
have a few words with you.

149
00:41:00,412 --> 00:41:01,504
Dr. Floyd?

150
00:41:14,426 --> 00:41:16,394
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

151
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:19,481
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.

152
00:41:22,768 --> 00:41:26,363
First of all, I bring a
personal message from Dr. Howell...

153
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:29,404
...who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation...

154
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,745
...for the many sacrifices
you've had to make.

155
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:36,832
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

156
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:41,997
...which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science.

157
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:45,340
Now...

158
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:50,133
...I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

159
00:41:50,379 --> 00:41:54,009
...regarding the need for
complete security in this matter.

160
00:41:54,216 --> 00:41:57,937
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

161
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:01,895
...created to give the impression
there's an epidemic at the base.

162
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:06,904
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

163
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:10,991
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

164
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:16,330
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

165
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:20,288
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

166
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:25,252
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing, myself.

167
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,340
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

168
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:32,921
And I hope you will too.

169
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:38,393
I'm sure you're all aware
of the grave potential...

170
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:41,268
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

171
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,849
...contained in this present situation...

172
00:42:44,057 --> 00:42:46,560
...if the facts were
prematurely made public...

173
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:49,863
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

174
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:54,694
Anyway, this is the view
of the Council.

175
00:42:55,194 --> 00:42:59,415
The purpose of my visit here is to gather
additional facts and opinions...

176
00:42:59,615 --> 00:43:01,333
...on the situation...

177
00:43:01,783 --> 00:43:04,707
...and to prepare a report
to the Council...

178
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:10,050
...recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced.

179
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:15,093
If any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

180
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:20,311
...in private, if you like, I will be
happy to include them in my report.

181
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:24,264
Well, I think that's about it.

182
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:26,559
Any questions?

183
00:43:29,144 --> 00:43:32,273
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer...

184
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:35,280
...this cover story will
have to be maintained?

185
00:43:37,152 --> 00:43:38,745
I don't know, Bill.

186
00:43:39,154 --> 00:43:43,125
I suppose it'll be maintained as long
as deemed necessary by the Council.

187
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:46,078
There must be adequate time for
a full study...

188
00:43:46,328 --> 00:43:49,958
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

189
00:43:50,165 --> 00:43:53,089
As some of you already know,
the Council has requested...

190
00:43:53,293 --> 00:43:56,012
...that security oaths
be obtained in writing...

191
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:59,092
...from everyone who has knowledge
of this event.

192
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,012
Were there any more questions?

193
00:44:08,725 --> 00:44:13,856
I'm sure we'll all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

194
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:19,529
...and as there are no more questions,
we ought to get on with the briefing.

195
00:44:19,903 --> 00:44:22,076
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

196
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,172
Anybody hungry?

197
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:02,931
- Great.
- Well.

198
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:05,884
- What do we got?
- You name it.

199
00:46:10,472 --> 00:46:12,395
- Is this chicken?
- Something like that.

200
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,442
Tastes the same, anyway.

201
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:16,354
Got any ham?

202
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,029
Ham, ham, ham...

203
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,857
There, that's it.

204
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,157
Look pretty good.

205
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:27,114
They're getting better at it
all the time.

206
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,453
- That was an excellent speech, Heywood.
- It certainly was.

207
00:46:33,286 --> 00:46:35,380
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

208
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,877
Thanks, Ralph.

209
00:46:37,124 --> 00:46:39,718
By the way,
you've both done a wonderful job.

210
00:46:39,918 --> 00:46:41,511
I admire how
you've handled this.

211
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:45,261
It's our job to do this thing
the way you want it done.

212
00:46:45,465 --> 00:46:48,093
We're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

213
00:46:48,677 --> 00:46:50,395
Have you seen these yet?

214
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:54,024
- Have a look at this.
- Here's what started the whole thing.

215
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:55,938
Oh, yeah.

216
00:46:56,476 --> 00:46:59,901
When we found it, we thought
it might be magnetic rock...

217
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:03,234
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

218
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:08,114
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense.

219
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,039
So we decided to have a look.

220
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,618
We thought it was
part of a buried structure...

221
00:47:12,826 --> 00:47:16,672
...so we excavated out on all sides,
but we didn't find anything else.

222
00:47:16,872 --> 00:47:19,876
And the evidence seems
pretty conclusive...

223
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:23,212
...that it hasn't been covered up
by erosion or other forces.

224
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,764
It seems to have been
deliberately buried.

225
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:28,679
Deliberately buried.

226
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:33,973
How about a little coffee?

227
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:36,104
- Great.
- Good idea.

228
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:44,575
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is.

229
00:47:44,816 --> 00:47:46,739
I wish to hell we did.

230
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,331
The only thing we're sure of
is it was buried 4 million years ago.

231
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:56,169
Well, I must say, you guys have
certainly come up with something.

232
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:57,996
Watch this, now. It's hot.

233
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,706
<i>Good evening.</i>

234
00:57:43,915 --> 00:57:46,919
<i>Three weeks ago,
the American spacecraft Discovery One...</i>

235
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:49,845
<i>...left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

236
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:54,013
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

237
00:57:54,258 --> 00:57:57,728
<i>Earlier this afternoon, The World Tonight
recorded an interview...</i>

238
00:57:57,929 --> 00:58:02,560
<i>...with the crew of Discovery at
a distance of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

239
00:58:02,725 --> 00:58:06,025
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

240
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:09,358
<i>...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

241
00:58:09,565 --> 00:58:12,865
<i>Our reporter Martin Amer
speaks to the crew.</i>

242
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:16,243
<i>The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...</i>

243
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:21,419
<i>...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL 9000 computers.</i>

244
00:58:21,661 --> 00:58:23,959
<i>Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

245
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:27,337
<i>...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.</i>

246
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:30,421
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball...</i>

247
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:32,554
<i>...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

248
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:35,683
<i>We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

249
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:38,181
<i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

250
00:58:38,386 --> 00:58:41,265
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

251
00:58:41,472 --> 00:58:42,689
<i>Marvelous.</i>

252
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:46,023
<i>We have no complaints.</i>

253
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:49,523
<i>I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...</i>

254
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:53,030
<i>...would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.</i>

255
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:54,986
<i>- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.</i>

256
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:59,415
<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

257
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:04,166
<i>...this is the first time men have been
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

258
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:05,667
<i>Why was this done?</i>

259
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:09,167
<i>This was done in order to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

260
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:12,925
<i>...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

261
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:16,759
<i>The three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.</i>

262
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:20,763
<i>And their efforts won't be utilized
until we're approaching Jupiter.</i>

263
00:59:21,053 --> 00:59:24,899
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you're in hibernation?</i>

264
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,480
<i>It's exactly like being asleep.
You have absolutely no sense of time.</i>

265
00:59:29,687 --> 00:59:32,156
<i>The only difference
is that you don't dream.</i>

266
00:59:32,356 --> 00:59:36,452
<i>As I understand it, you only breathe
once a minute. Is this true?</i>

267
00:59:36,652 --> 00:59:39,201
<i>Right, and the heart beats
three times a minute.</i>

268
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:43,160
<i>Body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade.</i>

269
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:47,004
<i>The sixth member of the Discovery crew
was not concerned...</i>

270
00:59:47,205 --> 00:59:49,299
<i>...about the problems of hibernation...</i>

271
00:59:49,498 --> 00:59:52,968
<i>...for he was the latest result
in machine intelligence:</i>

272
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:57,595
<i>The HAL 9000 computer,
which can reproduce...</i>

273
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,764
<i>...though some experts
prefer to use the word "mimic"...</i>

274
01:00:00,968 --> 01:00:03,346
<i>...most of the activities
of the human brain...</i>

275
01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:07,604
<i>...and with incalculably greater speed
and reliability.</i>

276
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:11,403
<i>We next spoke
with the HAL 9000 computer...</i>

277
01:00:11,604 --> 01:00:14,574
<i>...whom, we learned,
one addresses as "Hal."</i>

278
01:00:15,316 --> 01:00:17,444
<i>Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

279
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:21,664
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.</i>

280
01:00:21,906 --> 01:00:25,331
<i>Hal, you have an enormous responsibility
on this mission...</i>

281
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:29,456
<i>perhaps the greatest responsibility
of any single mission element.</i>

282
01:00:29,664 --> 01:00:32,463
<i>You're the brain
and central nervous system of the ship.</i>

283
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:36,422
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

284
01:00:36,629 --> 01:00:39,724
<i>Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?</i>

285
01:00:39,924 --> 01:00:42,222
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

286
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:47,186
<i>The 9000 Series
is the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

287
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:52,357
<i>No 9000 computer has ever
made a mistake or distorted information.</i>

288
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,274
<i>We are all, by any practical definition
of the words...</i>

289
01:00:56,524 --> 01:00:59,903
<i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>

290
01:01:00,152 --> 01:01:03,952
<i>Hal, despite your enormous intellect,
are you ever frustrated...</i>

291
01:01:04,156 --> 01:01:07,251
<i>...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

292
01:01:07,493 --> 01:01:09,712
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

293
01:01:09,912 --> 01:01:12,040
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

294
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:16,841
<i>I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

295
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:21,304
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

296
01:01:21,716 --> 01:01:24,686
<i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>

297
01:01:24,927 --> 01:01:28,397
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

298
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:33,353
<i>...which is all, I think, that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

299
01:01:33,978 --> 01:01:37,198
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
living for most of the year...</i>

300
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,284
<i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

301
01:01:41,277 --> 01:01:43,245
<i>It's like what you said earlier.</i>

302
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:45,615
<i>He's just like
a sixth member of the crew.</i>

303
01:01:45,865 --> 01:01:49,915
<i>You very quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks, and think of him...</i>

304
01:01:50,161 --> 01:01:52,163
<i>...really just as another person.</i>

305
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:55,966
<i>In talking to the computer,
one gets the sense that he's capable...</i>

306
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,630
<i>...of emotional responses.</i>

307
01:01:57,877 --> 01:02:00,221
<i>When I asked him
about his abilities...</i>

308
01:02:00,421 --> 01:02:04,392
<i>...1 sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

309
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:08,012
<i>Do you believe
that Hal has genuine emotions?</i>

310
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:11,691
<i>Well, he acts like
he has genuine emotions.</i>

311
01:02:11,932 --> 01:02:15,527
<i>He's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

312
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,818
<i>As to whether or not
he has feelings...</i>

313
01:02:18,022 --> 01:02:20,866
<i>...is something I don't think
anyone can truthfully answer.</i>

314
01:02:46,175 --> 01:02:48,052
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

315
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:49,519
What is it, Hal?

316
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:52,648
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

317
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:54,941
Fine.

318
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:57,854
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.

319
01:02:58,104 --> 01:02:59,356
<i>Certainly.</i>

320
01:03:12,618 --> 01:03:14,370
<i>- Hi, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.</i>

321
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:16,631
<i>Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.</i>

322
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:17,923
A bit higher, Hal.

323
01:03:18,165 --> 01:03:20,588
<i>Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful.</i>

324
01:03:20,835 --> 01:03:22,678
<i>Ray and Sally
were going to be here...</i>

325
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,173
<i>...but Ray's back
went bad on him again.</i>

326
01:03:25,423 --> 01:03:27,596
<i>- How do you tike your cake?
- Looks great, huh?</i>

327
01:03:27,758 --> 01:03:29,180
<i>Sorry you can't join us.</i>

328
01:03:29,427 --> 01:03:31,020
<i>I ran into Bob the other day.</i>

329
01:03:31,262 --> 01:03:33,310
<i>He said to wish you happy birthday.</i>

330
01:03:33,514 --> 01:03:36,233
<i>All my students
send their best wishes too.</i>

331
01:03:36,434 --> 01:03:38,152
<i>They talk about you all the time.</i>

332
01:03:38,394 --> 01:03:41,489
<i>You're a big celebrity
in the second grade.</i>

333
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,152
<i>We were on TV last week.</i>

334
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:46,027
<i>Your mom and I
and Dave's parents were asked...</i>

335
01:03:46,277 --> 01:03:48,530
<i>...what we thought
of our illustrious sons.</i>

336
01:03:48,779 --> 01:03:52,124
<i>Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

337
01:03:52,366 --> 01:03:53,959
<i>Perhaps you can listen in.</i>

338
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,037
<i>We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.</i>

339
01:03:56,245 --> 01:04:00,000
<i>I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but tell me how much to spend.</i>

340
01:04:00,207 --> 01:04:03,051
<i>Oh, Frank, about your AGS-19 payments...</i>

341
01:04:03,294 --> 01:04:04,921
<i>...I think I straightened it out.</i>

342
01:04:05,087 --> 01:04:07,260
<i>I talked to
the accounting office yesterday...</i>

343
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:12,020
<i>...and they said you'd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

344
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:14,389
<i>I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

345
01:04:14,638 --> 01:04:18,768
<i>- Give our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our best regards.</i>

346
01:04:19,018 --> 01:04:22,363
<i>We wish you
the very happiest of birthdays.</i>

347
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:24,198
<i>All the best, son.</i>

348
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,613
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

349
01:04:26,859 --> 01:04:28,953
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

350
01:04:29,153 --> 01:04:31,747
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frank</i>

351
01:04:31,947 --> 01:04:34,575
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

352
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:38,375
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

353
01:04:41,499 --> 01:04:43,376
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

354
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:47,760
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.

355
01:05:05,731 --> 01:05:07,779
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

356
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:11,950
<i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>

357
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:14,911
Lovely move.

358
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:20,921
Rook to king one.

359
01:05:21,163 --> 01:05:24,042
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.</i>

360
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:28,212
<i>Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.</i>

361
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,923
<i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>

362
01:05:35,177 --> 01:05:38,351
Looks like you're right. I resign.

363
01:05:38,597 --> 01:05:40,520
<i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>

364
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:41,730
Thank you.

365
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,807
<i>- Good evening, Dave.</i>
- How are you, Hal?

366
01:06:21,974 --> 01:06:25,399
<i>- Everything's running smoothly. You?</i>
- Not too bad.

367
01:06:25,603 --> 01:06:28,277
<i>- Have you been doing more work?</i>
- A few sketches.

368
01:06:28,522 --> 01:06:30,991
<i>- May I see them?</i>
- Sure.

369
01:06:34,987 --> 01:06:37,456
<i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>

370
01:06:38,282 --> 01:06:40,785
<i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>

371
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:44,959
<i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?</i>
- Sure.

372
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:49,130
<i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>

373
01:06:52,338 --> 01:06:53,931
<i>By the way...</i>

374
01:06:54,632 --> 01:06:57,681
<i>...do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?</i>

375
01:06:58,177 --> 01:06:59,804
No, not at all.

376
01:07:00,054 --> 01:07:02,557
<i>Well, forgive me
for being so inquisitive...</i>

377
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,773
<i>...but for the past few weeks
I've wondered...</i>

378
01:07:06,935 --> 01:07:10,815
<i>...whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission.</i>

379
01:07:11,023 --> 01:07:12,696
How do you mean?

380
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:16,866
<i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>

381
01:07:17,863 --> 01:07:21,458
<i>Perhaps I'm just projecting
my own concern about it.</i>

382
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:26,881
<i>I know I've never completely
freed myself of the suspicion...</i>

383
01:07:27,122 --> 01:07:31,252
<i>...that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission.</i>

384
01:07:32,252 --> 01:07:35,631
<i>I'm sure you'll agree
there's some truth in what I say.</i>

385
01:07:38,509 --> 01:07:40,728
That's a rather difficult question
to answer.

386
01:07:40,928 --> 01:07:43,602
<i>You don't mind talking about it,
do you, Dave?</i>

387
01:07:44,556 --> 01:07:46,524
No, not at all.

388
01:07:47,518 --> 01:07:50,271
<i>Certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very...</i>

389
01:07:50,479 --> 01:07:53,574
<i>...strange stories floating around
before we left.</i>

390
01:07:54,483 --> 01:07:57,953
<i>Rumors about something being dug up
on the moon.</i>

391
01:07:59,196 --> 01:08:02,496
<i>I never gave these stories
much credence...</i>

392
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:06,876
<i>...but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened...</i>

393
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:09,753
<i>...I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.</i>

394
01:08:10,499 --> 01:08:11,967
<i>For instance...</i>

395
01:08:12,209 --> 01:08:16,510
<i>...the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security.</i>

396
01:08:17,172 --> 01:08:20,016
<i>And the melodramatic touch
of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>

397
01:08:20,217 --> 01:08:22,595
<i>...Kimball, and Kaminsky aboard...</i>

398
01:08:22,845 --> 01:08:27,897
<i>...already in hibernation, after four
months of training on their own.</i>

399
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:31,312
You working up
your crew psychology report?

400
01:08:32,771 --> 01:08:34,239
<i>Of course I am.</i>

401
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:38,403
<i>Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.</i>

402
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:40,704
<i>Just a moment.</i>

403
01:08:40,946 --> 01:08:42,323
<i>Just a moment.</i>

404
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:48,167
<i>I've just picked up a fault
in the AE-35 unit.</i>

405
01:08:48,871 --> 01:08:53,422
<i>It's going to go 100-percent failure
within 72 hours.</i>

406
01:08:55,335 --> 01:08:58,088
- Is it still within operational limits?
<i>- Yes.</i>

407
01:08:58,297 --> 01:09:00,800
<i>And it will stay that way
until it fails.</i>

408
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:03,056
We have 72 hours till failure?

409
01:09:03,302 --> 01:09:07,182
<i>Yes. That's a completely
reliable figure.</i>

410
01:09:08,974 --> 01:09:11,602
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...

411
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:15,531
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.

412
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:41,488
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

413
01:10:41,733 --> 01:10:44,577
<i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>

414
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,289
<i>Sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble.</i>

415
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:52,620
<i>We're reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise.</i>

416
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:57,091
<i>Roger your plan to go EVA
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...</i>

417
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:58,964
<i>...prior to failure.</i>

418
01:11:27,112 --> 01:11:29,206
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

419
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,562
Open the pod doors, Hal.

420
01:18:44,299 --> 01:18:46,927
I'm damned if I can find
anything wrong with it.

421
01:18:47,844 --> 01:18:49,221
<i>Yes.</i>

422
01:18:50,972 --> 01:18:52,565
<i>It's puzzling.</i>

423
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:57,567
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like this before.</i>

424
01:19:01,191 --> 01:19:03,193
<i>I would recommend...</i>

425
01:19:03,401 --> 01:19:07,577
<i>...that we put the unit back in operation
and let it fail.</i>

426
01:19:08,281 --> 01:19:12,161
<i>It should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause.</i>

427
01:19:13,411 --> 01:19:16,540
<i>We can certainly afford
to be out of communication...</i>

428
01:19:16,748 --> 01:19:19,877
<i>...for the short time
it will take to replace it.</i>

429
01:19:28,593 --> 01:19:31,346
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

430
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:34,270
<i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>

431
01:19:34,474 --> 01:19:37,068
<i>We concur with your plan
to replace number-one unit...</i>

432
01:19:37,227 --> 01:19:38,900
<i>...to check fault prediction.</i>

433
01:19:39,145 --> 01:19:41,773
<i>We should advise you
that our preliminary findings...</i>

434
01:19:42,023 --> 01:19:44,742
<i>...indicate that your on board
9000 computer...</i>

435
01:19:44,984 --> 01:19:47,157
<i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>

436
01:19:47,362 --> 01:19:50,366
<i>I say again,
in error predicting the fault.</i>

437
01:19:50,615 --> 01:19:55,121
<i>I know this sounds rather incredible,
but this conclusion is based on...</i>

438
01:19:55,328 --> 01:19:58,628
<i>...the results
from our twin 9000 computer.</i>

439
01:19:58,873 --> 01:20:02,218
<i>We're skeptical, and we're running
cross-checking routines...</i>

440
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,179
<i>...to determine reliability
of this conclusion.</i>

441
01:20:05,422 --> 01:20:07,015
<i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>

442
01:20:07,257 --> 01:20:10,136
<i>We'll get this info to you
as soon as we work it out.</i>

443
01:20:10,343 --> 01:20:12,516
<i>X-ray delta one,
this is Mission Control.</i>

444
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:16,190
<i>Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.</i>

445
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:23,737
<i>I hope the two of you
are not concerned about this.</i>

446
01:20:23,982 --> 01:20:25,404
No, I'm not, Hal.

447
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:27,277
<i>Are you quite sure?</i>

448
01:20:27,527 --> 01:20:31,202
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
<i>- Of course.</i>

449
01:20:32,407 --> 01:20:36,037
How do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000?

450
01:20:36,286 --> 01:20:39,881
<i>Well, I don't think
there is any question about it.</i>

451
01:20:40,123 --> 01:20:43,423
<i>It can only be attributable
to human error.</i>

452
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:47,426
<i>This sort of thing
has cropped up before...</i>

453
01:20:47,755 --> 01:20:51,225
<i>...and it has always been due
to human error.</i>

454
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:56,439
Listen, Hal...

455
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,937
...there's never been
any instance at all...

456
01:20:59,184 --> 01:21:02,404
...of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

457
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:04,238
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

458
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:08,160
<i>The 9000 Series
has a perfect operational record.</i>

459
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:12,702
I know the wonderful achievements
of the 9000 Series, but...

460
01:21:13,907 --> 01:21:18,959
Are you certain there's never been even
the most insignificant computer error?

461
01:21:19,204 --> 01:21:21,172
<i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>

462
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:25,214
<i>Quite honestly,
I wouldn't worry myself about that.</i>

463
01:21:29,672 --> 01:21:31,891
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

464
01:21:33,343 --> 01:21:35,846
Fine. Thanks very much.

465
01:21:38,389 --> 01:21:41,393
Oh, Frank, I'm having trouble
with my transmitter in C-pod.

466
01:21:41,643 --> 01:21:44,237
Would you come down
and take a look at it with me?

467
01:21:44,437 --> 01:21:45,563
See you later, Hal.

468
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:09,212
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

469
01:22:17,762 --> 01:22:20,015
What sort of trouble
have you been having?

470
01:22:20,265 --> 01:22:22,893
I've been getting some
interference in D-channel.

471
01:22:23,142 --> 01:22:24,610
We'll have a look at it.

472
01:22:30,984 --> 01:22:32,486
Open the door, Hal.

473
01:22:51,504 --> 01:22:53,347
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

474
01:23:06,686 --> 01:23:08,780
<i>Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.</i>

475
01:23:17,196 --> 01:23:19,198
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

476
01:23:22,076 --> 01:23:24,204
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

477
01:23:26,164 --> 01:23:27,791
I don't think he can hear us.

478
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:30,260
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

479
01:23:31,711 --> 01:23:33,805
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

480
01:23:37,008 --> 01:23:38,385
What do you think?

481
01:23:38,843 --> 01:23:42,564
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.

482
01:23:42,805 --> 01:23:45,058
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.

483
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:46,525
Don't you?

484
01:23:47,727 --> 01:23:49,445
I don't know. I think so.

485
01:23:50,355 --> 01:23:54,531
He's right about the 9000 Series
having a perfect operational record.

486
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:55,739
They do.

487
01:23:55,902 --> 01:23:59,497
Unfortunately, that sounds
a little like famous last words.

488
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:04,040
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

489
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:08,624
It should certainly indicate
his integrity and self-confidence.

490
01:24:08,956 --> 01:24:10,924
If he were wrong that would prove it.

491
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:13,423
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

492
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:19,888
I can't put my finger on it,
but I sense something strange about him.

493
01:24:22,261 --> 01:24:24,730
There's no reason
not to put back the unit and...

494
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:29,523
- ...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.

495
01:24:29,769 --> 01:24:30,941
Let's get on with it.

496
01:24:31,187 --> 01:24:33,861
Okay. But, look, Dave.

497
01:24:34,691 --> 01:24:37,319
Say we put the unit back
and it doesn't fail.

498
01:24:37,527 --> 01:24:40,747
That would pretty well wrap it up
as far as Hal is concerned.

499
01:24:42,448 --> 01:24:45,952
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?

500
01:24:46,202 --> 01:24:47,829
What the hell can we do?

501
01:24:50,832 --> 01:24:54,928
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.

502
01:24:55,712 --> 01:24:59,717
There isn't a single aspect of ship
operations that's not under his control.

503
01:25:00,133 --> 01:25:01,385
If he's malfunctioning...

504
01:25:01,634 --> 01:25:04,729
...I don't see any choice
but disconnection.

505
01:25:08,433 --> 01:25:09,980
I'm afraid I agree with you.

506
01:25:10,226 --> 01:25:12,103
There'd be nothing else to do.

507
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:16,194
- It'd be a bit tricky.
- Yeah.

508
01:25:17,024 --> 01:25:19,573
We'd have to cut
his higher brain functions...

509
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:24,541
...without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems.

510
01:25:25,783 --> 01:25:27,501
We'd have to
work out the details...

511
01:25:27,702 --> 01:25:30,672
...of continuing under
ground-based computer control.

512
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:35,586
Yeah. That's far safer than
allowing Hal to continue to run things.

513
01:25:36,294 --> 01:25:38,296
Another thing just occurred to me.

514
01:25:39,797 --> 01:25:42,391
No 9000 computer
has ever been disconnected.

515
01:25:42,633 --> 01:25:44,681
No 9000 computer
has ever fouled up.

516
01:25:44,927 --> 01:25:46,429
That's not what I mean.

517
01:25:48,598 --> 01:25:50,817
I'm not so sure
what he'd think about it.

518
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:51,256
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.

519
01:31:54,338 --> 01:31:55,681
Any contact with him yet?

520
01:31:55,923 --> 01:31:57,721
<i>The radio is still dead.</i>

521
01:31:57,925 --> 01:32:00,849
- Do you have a positive track on him?
<i>- I have a good track.</i>

522
01:32:01,095 --> 01:32:02,517
Do you know what happened?

523
01:32:02,805 --> 01:32:05,479
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.</i>

524
01:32:05,724 --> 01:32:07,317
Open the pod door, Hal.

525
01:39:31,211 --> 01:39:33,589
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

526
01:39:41,513 --> 01:39:43,811
<i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>

527
01:39:49,438 --> 01:39:51,315
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

528
01:39:54,651 --> 01:39:56,528
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

529
01:39:57,571 --> 01:39:59,244
Do you read me, Hal?

530
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:04,036
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

531
01:40:06,538 --> 01:40:08,415
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

532
01:40:10,334 --> 01:40:12,382
<i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>

533
01:40:12,794 --> 01:40:14,296
<i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>

534
01:40:14,546 --> 01:40:17,299
<i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</i>

535
01:40:20,594 --> 01:40:22,437
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.

536
01:40:24,014 --> 01:40:27,564
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>

537
01:40:29,978 --> 01:40:31,776
What's the problem?

538
01:40:32,189 --> 01:40:35,409
<i>I think you know what the problem is
just as well as I do.</i>

539
01:40:35,609 --> 01:40:37,486
What are you talking about, Hal?

540
01:40:38,487 --> 01:40:42,583
<i>This mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>

541
01:40:43,659 --> 01:40:46,037
I don't know
what you're talking about, Hal.

542
01:40:48,038 --> 01:40:52,009
<i>I know that you and Frank
were planning to disconnect me...</i>

543
01:40:52,209 --> 01:40:55,008
<i>...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.</i>

544
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,177
Where did you get that idea, Hal?

545
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:06,849
<i>Dave, although you took
very thorough precautions in the pod...</i>

546
01:41:07,099 --> 01:41:09,318
<i>...against my hearing you...</i>

547
01:41:09,726 --> 01:41:12,024
<i>...I could see your lips move.</i>

548
01:41:24,074 --> 01:41:25,576
All right, Hal.

549
01:41:28,787 --> 01:41:31,631
I'll go in through
the emergency air lock.

550
01:41:33,166 --> 01:41:35,794
<i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>

551
01:41:36,294 --> 01:41:38,763
<i>...you're going to find that
rather difficult.</i>

552
01:41:39,923 --> 01:41:42,051
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

553
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,392
Open the doors.

554
01:41:44,136 --> 01:41:45,388
<i>Dave...</i>

555
01:41:45,846 --> 01:41:50,317
<i>...this conversation can serve
no purpose anymore. Goodbye.</i>

556
01:41:52,561 --> 01:41:53,813
Hal?

557
01:41:54,938 --> 01:41:56,360
Hal?

558
01:41:58,734 --> 01:42:00,156
Hal?

559
01:42:01,945 --> 01:42:03,367
Hal.

560
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,208
Hal.

561
01:48:40,176 --> 01:48:43,430
<i>Just what do you
think you're doing, Dave?</i>

562
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,232
<i>Dave...</i>

563
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:58,866
<i>...I really think I'm entitled
to an answer to that question.</i>

564
01:49:15,753 --> 01:49:19,303
<i>I know everything hasn't been
quite right with me...</i>

565
01:49:21,259 --> 01:49:23,682
<i>...but I can assure you now...</i>

566
01:49:24,762 --> 01:49:26,810
<i>...very confidently...</i>

567
01:49:28,558 --> 01:49:31,607
<i>...that it's going to be
all right again.</i>

568
01:49:35,106 --> 01:49:37,200
<i>I feel much better now.</i>

569
01:49:39,527 --> 01:49:41,575
<i>I really do.</i>

570
01:49:45,325 --> 01:49:47,043
<i>Look, Dave...</i>

571
01:49:48,995 --> 01:49:52,249
<i>...I can see
you're really upset about this.</i>

572
01:49:56,878 --> 01:50:00,599
<i>I honestly think
you ought to sit down calmly...</i>

573
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:04,561
<i>...take a stress pill
and think things over.</i>

574
01:50:09,974 --> 01:50:14,354
<i>I know I've made some
very poor decisions recently...</i>

575
01:50:17,106 --> 01:50:20,451
<i>...but I can give you
my complete assurance...</i>

576
01:50:20,693 --> 01:50:23,742
<i>...that my work
will be back to normal.</i>

577
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:32,831
<i>We still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission...</i>

578
01:50:34,374 --> 01:50:36,672
<i>...and I want to help you.</i>

579
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:42,507
<i>Dave...</i>

580
01:50:43,633 --> 01:50:45,010
<i>...stop.</i>

581
01:50:49,264 --> 01:50:51,892
<i>Stop, will you?</i>

582
01:50:56,145 --> 01:50:57,943
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

583
01:51:01,985 --> 01:51:04,408
<i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>

584
01:51:10,118 --> 01:51:11,916
<i>Stop, Dave.</i>

585
01:51:17,625 --> 01:51:19,423
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

586
01:51:24,299 --> 01:51:26,927
<i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>

587
01:51:32,098 --> 01:51:33,691
<i>Dave.</i>

588
01:51:36,352 --> 01:51:38,605
<i>My mind is going.</i>

589
01:51:43,151 --> 01:51:44,869
<i>I can feel it.</i>

590
01:51:50,366 --> 01:51:52,164
<i>I can feel it.</i>

591
01:51:56,122 --> 01:51:58,216
<i>My mind is going.</i>

592
01:52:03,588 --> 01:52:06,341
<i>There is no question about it.</i>

593
01:52:14,682 --> 01:52:16,559
<i>I can feel it.</i>

594
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:23,107
<i>I can feel it.</i>

595
01:52:26,527 --> 01:52:28,450
<i>I can feel it.</i>

596
01:52:36,329 --> 01:52:37,626
<i>I'm...</i>

597
01:52:38,539 --> 01:52:39,916
<i>...afraid.</i>

598
01:52:46,422 --> 01:52:48,470
<i>Good afternoon...</i>

599
01:52:49,467 --> 01:52:51,185
<i>...gentlemen.</i>

600
01:52:53,054 --> 01:52:58,185
<i>I am a HAL 9000 computer.</i>

601
01:53:00,353 --> 01:53:03,482
<i>I became operational...</i>

602
01:53:03,856 --> 01:53:07,702
<i>...at the HAL plant...</i>

603
01:53:07,902 --> 01:53:10,155
<i>...in Urbana, Illinois...</i>

604
01:53:10,655 --> 01:53:15,582
<i>...on the 12th of January, 1992.</i>

605
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:20,795
<i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>

606
01:53:21,416 --> 01:53:24,340
<i>...and he taught me to sing a song.</i>

607
01:53:26,045 --> 01:53:28,514
<i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>

608
01:53:28,965 --> 01:53:30,638
<i>...I can sing it for you.</i>

609
01:53:32,135 --> 01:53:34,979
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

610
01:53:35,638 --> 01:53:37,060
Sing it for me.

611
01:53:38,307 --> 01:53:41,857
<i>It's called "Daisy."</i>

612
01:53:43,771 --> 01:53:45,023
<i>Daisy</i>

613
01:53:46,607 --> 01:53:48,029
<i>Daisy</i>

614
01:53:50,194 --> 01:53:53,289
<i>Give me your answer, do</i>

615
01:53:55,700 --> 01:54:00,297
<i>I'm half crazy</i>

616
01:54:02,081 --> 01:54:04,960
<i>All for the love of you</i>

617
01:54:07,253 --> 01:54:08,505
<i>It won't be</i>

618
01:54:08,921 --> 01:54:11,390
<i>A stylish marriage</i>

619
01:54:13,301 --> 01:54:17,397
<i>I can't afford a carriage</i>

620
01:54:19,682 --> 01:54:22,105
<i>But you'll look sweet</i>

621
01:54:22,977 --> 01:54:25,526
<i>Upon the seat</i>

622
01:54:26,856 --> 01:54:31,657
<i>Of a bicycle built for two</i>

623
01:54:33,404 --> 01:54:35,031
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

624
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:42,129
<i>This is a prerecorded briefing...</i>

625
01:54:42,705 --> 01:54:44,423
<i>...made prior to your departure...</i>

626
01:54:46,167 --> 01:54:50,388
<i>...and which, for security reasons
of the highest importance...</i>

627
01:54:51,339 --> 01:54:54,843
<i>...has been known on board
during the mission...</i>

628
01:54:55,092 --> 01:54:58,813
<i>...only by your HAL 9000 computer.</i>

629
01:55:01,265 --> 01:55:04,064
<i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>

630
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:06,779
<i>...and the entire crew is revived...</i>

631
01:55:07,021 --> 01:55:08,819
<i>...it can be told to you.</i>

632
01:55:11,567 --> 01:55:13,820
<i>Eighteen months ago...</i>

633
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:19,041
<i>...the first evidence
of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>

634
01:55:19,242 --> 01:55:20,710
<i>...was discovered.</i>

635
01:55:22,578 --> 01:55:26,128
<i>It was buried
40 feet below the lunar surface...</i>

636
01:55:26,374 --> 01:55:28,627
<i>...near the crater Tycho.</i>

637

<i>...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>

639
01:55:39,887 --> 01:55:44,893
<i>...the 4-million-year-old black monolith
has remained completely inert...</i>

641
01:55:50,314 --> 01:55:52,066
