1
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,217
How's it going?

2
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,594
Hey.

3
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,679
It's been pretty non-stop.

4
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,307
Let me get this to you now.

5
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:01,018
You know, some of Stacy's
friends are having

6
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,519
a party over at Logan Square tonight.

7
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:03,562
You want to come?

8
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:04,980
Does Stacy want me to come?

9
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:06,690
Yeah, she's the one who
asked me to invite you.

10
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,400
You should come.

11
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:10,193
You'd really like her.
She's pretty incredible.

12
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:12,279
Did you tell her about us?

13
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,449
Not yet. But I'm sure she'll
understand, it's in the past.

14
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,036
Don't be naive.

15
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:21,330
Cash it soon.

16
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,332
You're so cynical.

17
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:25,000
See ya.

18
00:01:27,377 --> 00:01:31,340
I want you to amend claim 32.

19
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,883
Hold on.

20
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,386
You've got great organizational skills.

21
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:37,846
It's all up here.

22
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:39,806
I know where everything is.

23
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:44,019
I'm hearing some rumors...

24
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:45,020
Christine...

25
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,313
Ben Holgrem.

26
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,065
Learn this guy's face.

27
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:49,524
He's the devil.

28
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:52,319
My client is suing the
shit out of his client.

29
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:55,197
I heard XHP is unhappy with you.

30
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,782
Tell Susan to hold my calls.

31
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,959
He wants you to hold his calls.

32
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:27,312
I mean it's not something that
I want to make into a career,

33
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:28,689
but I actually enjoy it.

34
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,733
I like meeting new people,
I like having sex.

35
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,361
And I only do it a few times a month.

36
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,698
Do you meet all your clients online?

37
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,449
A few.

38
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:41,451
This woman, Jacqueline,
vets them for me,

39
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,453
and takes care of the bookings.

40
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:44,580
Why? Do you want to meet her?

41
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:47,457
I could introduce you, if you want.

42
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:49,459
No, just curious.

43
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,336
Okay.

44
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:53,338
But there's a difference
between being curious

45
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,507
and actually following through.

46
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,134
I'm aware of that.

47
00:02:57,175 --> 00:03:00,137
If you meet Jacqueline, she's
gonna wanna book for you.

48
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:02,472
You're smart and hot and funny.

49
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,600
You just have to want to do it.

50
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,768
I mean I get off on it.
I like the rush...

51
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,354
All the attention, knowing he wants me.

52
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:11,023
Then there's the money.

53
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:12,232
And at the end of the day,

54
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:13,525
if I don't get along with a client,

55
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,027
I just move on.

56
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:18,864
All I really have to do is
listen and ask questions.

57
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,616
And fuck?

58
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:22,367
Yeah.

59
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,911
And fuck.

60
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,644
Here's sixty.

61
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:49,811
Thanks.

62
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,844
- Hi.
- Hi, come on in.

63
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:26,598
You're gonna have to play
catch up. We're two deep.

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,433
Think I can handle that.

65
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,442
Look who's here?

66
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:38,443
Chelsea!

67
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:39,444
Hi.

68
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,696
Hey, glad you came.

69
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:41,863
Me, too.

70
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:45,867
You look beautiful.

71
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,703
Thank you.

72
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:51,456
No, it's interesting because
we have some sizable estates,

73
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:53,500
and there's no better sport

74
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,752
than watching the wealthy try
to hang onto their money.

75
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:57,462
Or try to get some

76
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,463
they think they deserve.

77
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,090
It just never gets old.

78
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,758
Really?

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,969
So it's not just the same
story over and over again

80
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:04,970
with different names?

81
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:05,846
Not yet.

82
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:07,973
And I've been doing this for 20 years.

83
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,516
Huh.

84
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,059
Do you have a lawyer?

85
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,394
Me? No.

86
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,855
Seriously? You should.

87
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:17,024
You can be my lawyer.

88
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:19,026
I would happily be your lawyer,

89
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,861
but then...

90
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,654
this would have to stop.

91
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,948
Why?

92
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,493
We're just starting to
get to know each other.

93
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:43,926
Keep it.

94
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:44,968
Welcome.

95
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,470
- Are you checking in?
- Yeah.

96
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,013
- Do you have any luggage?
- No.

97
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,172
Make yourself comfortable.

98
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:10,721
We're good?

99
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:13,265
Yeah. Great.

100
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,266
Drink?

101
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,519
Yes, vodka, please...

102
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:18,895
um, with soda.

103
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:44,796
Thanks.

104
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:00,145
Come here.

105
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,678
Do you like that?

106
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,012
Yes.

107
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:58,412
Yeah, listen, my 12 o'clock's
here now, so I gotta run,

108
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,622
but we'll talk about it later, okay?

109
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,040
Yeah...

110
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:04,042
We'll sort it out, I'm not worried.

111
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:06,628
Okay, bye-bye.

112
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,629
Jacqueline.

113
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:08,630
You are Christine.

114
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,007
I am.

115
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,759
You didn't tell me she was so beautiful!

116
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,303
She's great.

117
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:19,182
Federal Circuit has a monopoly
on all patent appeals.

118
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:20,851
It was established by Ronald Reagan and

119
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,644
is hardly met a patent it doesn't like.

120
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,688
If they make an error
interpreting patent code,

121
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,982
then every later judge is
obliged to follow their ruling.

122
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,527
The whole system is a complete mess.

123
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,778
It's so great you know this stuff.

124
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,988
Stuff like law?

125
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,781
Yes.

126
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:37,701
I do realize it's the result of
years of hard work and school,

127
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,745
and that's your passion.

128
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:41,622
Well, it's costing me enough.

129
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,249
It'll pay off.

130
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,501
At least from this end.

131
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,963
Now I already have a couple
of exceptional men in mind

132
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,924
who I think would love you.

133
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:53,425
Do you have any photos?

134
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,261
Okay...

135
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,888
We'll get you some.

136
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,225
Don't worry, no one will
ever see your eyes.

137
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,689
- You ready?
- Yeah.

138
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:08,690
Where do you want me?

139
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,275
Just up against the curtain.

140
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,491
That's perfect.

141
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,869
You look great.

142
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,247
Angle your chin up a little bit.

143
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,082
Beautiful.

144
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,876
Now just slowly start to
unbutton your blouse.

145
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,217
Perfect.

146
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,142
Beautiful.

147
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:51,108
Yeah, just chin up just a little bit.

148
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,234
Beautiful.

149
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,780
And turn to face the window.

150
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:00,826
Great.

151
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,203
Just lift the back of your
skirt up a little bit.

152
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:07,916
Gorgeous.

153
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,421
Beautiful.

154
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:02,179
It's whatever you're comfortable with,

155
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,765
and how much you wanna get paid.

156
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:08,143
I want to make sure that
you're matched properly.

157
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,478
For reasons I will let you figure out,

158
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,730
most of your clients will be white

159
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,774
and approaching middle age.

160
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,443
It should also be enjoyable for you.

161
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,820
I mean the more you enjoy
it, the more they will too.

162
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,364
My big question is...

163
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:23,951
Why would I go with you
when I can do this myself?

164
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,494
You mean why pay me?

165
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:26,745
Yeah.

166
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,081
Well, it's just math really.

167
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,250
And quality of life.

168
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,962
The hours that you would spend
finding and then vetting clients

169
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:38,507
could be spent with
clients, making money.

170
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:39,967
I'm the infrastructure.

171
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:42,803
You don't work for me, you work with me.

172
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:44,930
And if you're unhappy...

173
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,682
you leave.

174
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,141
There's no contract.

175
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:52,020
I already have one client.

176
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,188
Hmmm...

177
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,442
At least I think I do.

178
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:00,737
Okay, well, he's all yours.

179
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,155
Can I tell you about Ryan?

180
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,783
He's assertive.

181
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,369
He knows exactly what he likes,

182
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,080
but everyone who's seen
him had a great time.

183
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,248
What are you comfortable with?

184
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,874
Did you and Avery talk about it?

185
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,543
A little. I mean I get the gist of it.

186
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,919
Mm-hmm.

187
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,045
Bareback blow jobs?

188
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,505
Overnights?

189
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,007
Dinner at the Y?

190
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:20,799
Yeah.

191
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,092
I'm fine with all of that.

192
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,969
Great!

193
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,389
More wine?

194
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,112
Chelsea?

195
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,072
Ryan...

196
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,157
You're late.

197
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,284
I'm always late.

198
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,577
She's older.

199
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,078
Of course she is.

200
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,039
So you have one sister.
What does she do?

201
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,874
She's a math teacher.

202
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,875
What grade?

203
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,043
Middle school.

204
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:57,878
- Any kids?
- One.

205
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,089
A boy. He's 4. He's got a lisp.

206
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,215
A lisp?

207
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:03,550
That's cute.

208
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,635
What's his name?

209
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:07,262
Sean.

210
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,389
Bullshit.

211
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,225
Come on, you gotta rehearse this stuff.

212
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,311
Look, I know you're new,

213
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,480
but Jacqueline should be runnin'
bio drills with you or something.

214
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,357
Okay, she doesn't have a kid.

215
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:19,733
She could have 10 kids.

216
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,777
She could be a he. I don't care.

217
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,450
I think you should move
closer, "Chelsea".

218
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,327
Okay, "Ryan".

219
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,293
How was your day?

220
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:52,683
Are you on the pill?

221
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,976
Yes...

222
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,644
But I'd like to use a condom.

223
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,063
Yeah, I don't have any.

224
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,064
I do.

225
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,485
Let's go to the bathroom.

226
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,875
Face me.

227
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,677
Perfect.

228
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,304
Just like that.

229
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,513
Fuck.

230
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,655
Water is included.

231
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,199
Electric would be separate.

232
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,533
Take your time.

233
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,001
I think this place is great for you.

234
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,590
It's too expensive.

235
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,386
I can't afford this.

236
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,140
What if I cover the deposit?

237
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,811
And if you keep working,

238
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,938
it'll figure itself out.

239
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,447
Emery, this is part of the process.

240
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:16,076
I'm not trying to manipulate you!

241
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,037
I'm sure that when you come down...

242
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,416
Hey, we're doing
everything we fucking can!

243
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,626
Hello?

244
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,671
Shit!

245
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,715
We already gave you a chance.

246
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:31,383
This is how things move.

247
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,094
Don't fucking lecture
me on how things move!

248
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:34,928
Three mistrials.

249
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,139
Three fucking mistrials, David.

250
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,932
Explain to me why I need
to hear anything else

251
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,892
out of your mouth other
than you fucked up.

252
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,186
This is not the time to switch counsel.

253
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,648
You will lose if Kersner
sees you have doubts.

254
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,941
Do you get that?

255
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,359
I think what David is trying to say...

256
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,486
I don't need to hear the same
goddamn words in a different tone.

257
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,072
I completely understand where
you are coming from, Emery.

258
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,199
We, or maybe I should
just speak for myself,

259
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,077
I just want to know how to fix this.

260
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,871
How do you see this moving forward?

261
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,626
He didn't say. I don't know.

262
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,461
Maybe his wife's coming to town or

263
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:10,297
maybe he's just not
that into me anymore.

264
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,383
Either way, I have to pack
up my shit and leave.

265
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,220
It's really not that big a deal.

266
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,015
Just stay with me until
you figure it out.

267
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,142
Maybe Jacqueline can lend you
money. She charges enough.

268
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,272
How much are you paying her?

269
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,024
Same as you...

270
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,317
30%.

271
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,529
Kind of steep, no?

272
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,448
Yeah, but it's pretty standard.

273
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,492
Why, you don't like her?

274
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,577
No, she's great, I just...

275
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,579
30%'s a lot.

276
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,164
That's all.

277
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,958
You can tell me if you don't like her.

278
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,627
I like her.

279
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,133
Don't tell her I said anything.

280
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,510
Of course.

281
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,399
So, you can sleep in here.

282
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,527
Obviously, I haven't slept in
it, but it seems comfortable.

283
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,284
Ahhh, if you need to do
your laundry, it's the...

284
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,578
closet right next to the kitchen.

285
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,787
Yeah.

286
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,595
This place is really nice.

287
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,430
Yeah.

288
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,933
Still getting used to it, but I like it.

289
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,227
How much do you pay for it?

290
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,521
Probably too much.

291
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,273
Don't you have loans to pay off?

292
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,942
Yeah, Jacqueline actually put the
deposit down, so that helps.

293
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,321
So you can take "in calls"?

294
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,531
No, I am paying her back.
She was just helping.

295
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,325
Oh.

296
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,576
Here.

297
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,411
Just pay me back when you have it.

298
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,079
I have credit cards, I'm fine.

299
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,790
Speaking of which, let's go to lunch.

300
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,877
It's on me, it's the least I could do.

301
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,505
We'll have the forest
mushrooms, the kale salad,

302
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:20,469
the ahi tuna tartare, diver
scallops and two mimosas...

303
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,678
Please.

304
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,015
Thanks.

305
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,853
You deserve it.

306
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,188
We deserve it.

307
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,025
So how is work?

308
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,610
Which work?

309
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,945
I'm currently burning a
candle at three ends,

310
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,863
which I didn't know was possible.

311
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,490
Maybe one should go.

312
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,492
Yeah, maybe.

313
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,993
For now, it's fun.

314
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,163
And have you noticed that
people are fucking insane?

315
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,971
Hello.

316
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,056
Christine. Hi, it's Jacqueline.

317
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,767
Listen, I have someone
I'd love you to meet.

318
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,185
Are you free for lunch on Thursday?

319
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,937
Yeah, I can make that work.

320
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,107
I'm so sorry to hear that.

321
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,026
When did she pass away?

322
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,028
It's been eleven months now.

323
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,699
That's gotta be hard.

324
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,784
I think it's been harder on the kids.

325
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,953
Are you close to them?

326
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,912
I was...

327
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,664
Least I think I was.

328
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,501
But they're adults now.

329
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,798
They've got their own lives.

330
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:46,054
Why it's so nice to spend time
with someone and just talk.

331
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,015
Especially to a...

332
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,851
to a beautiful young woman.

333
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,478
We can talk whenever you like.

334
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,067
Jacqueline?

335
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,530
Oh, she-she's wonderful.

336
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,824
We're having a really
nice time together.

337
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,786
Declined?

338
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,040
Well, that's surprising.

339
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,667
Yeah.

340
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,710
Hang on.

341
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,796
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

342
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,844
Okay...

343
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,225
2226.

344
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,931
Christine...

345
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,477
What is it?

346
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,563
Was having problems sleeping.

347
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,025
I'm really sorry, I shouldn't
have brought him here.

348
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,988
Can I lie down beside you?

349
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,239
Yeah.

350
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,878
I'm sorry, I should have asked.

351
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,589
I can give you half for letting me.

352
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,134
- I'll give you $500.
- I don't want your money.

353
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,845
Jacqueline won't call me back.

354
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,640
- She won't tell me why.
- Go to sleep.

355
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,767
I have to get up at six in the morning.

356
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,894
Oh really? Fuck, I'm sorry.

357
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,245
You're really warm.

358
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,669
Thank you for being there for me.

359
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,212
Of course.

360
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,355
Kiss me.
